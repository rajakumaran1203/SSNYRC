    <string name="village_camp">“It’s not what the Nation done to us, but it’s what we have done to Nation”. A small step initiated to enforce this, Youth Red Cross has organized “village camp” on 26-01-2017. A three day camp was organized where 60 people took part effectively.\n\n
On the very first day, it has been an auspicious day since it’s a Republic day, Our volunteers gathered in one of the major schools in the village. We took part in their republic day celebrations. Many speeches were offered by the school children who were keenly interested in developing our country. Some our volunteers and professors spoke about the importance of the day. Our volunteers shared some of our memories with them by distributing chocolates. Our volunteers came to know about the facilities that the school had. We thought of improving the infrastructure of the school. We then made steps to initiate the process. From the very first day we started to develop the school premises.\n\n
Second day went on with a big bang, our volunteers had split up ourselves to 2-3 people and took in charge of each class. We were with them for the whole day. We spoke to them about the society, how the outside world is. We also guided them in fulfilling their wishes and dreams. It was an opportunity for every individual to guide the children in a righteous way, whereas some individuals took part in cleansing the school. They removed all the dirt from walls, painted all the walls and made the school clean with no sign of dust.\n\n
On the last day we made efforts for entertaining them and so we made it as a cultural day. We made use of morning hours by cleaning the village and a village survey has been taken by our volunteers. Some of our volunteers participated in guiding students in dance, drama and other activities.

    <string name="hospital_cleaning">“CLEANLINESS IS NEXT TO GODLINESS” is an age-old proverb, but it doesn’t fade away even now. The level of noise, temperature and the amount of light are all important but the cleanliness of the environment is crucial. Despite generally held views that environmental cleanliness is vital for infection prevention, there is little current robust evidence to support this view. Although a major focus of attention in the past, is about the environment was largely dismissed as insignificant in the transmission of infection in hospitals. Seeing it as a major concern YRC volunteers of SSNCE came forward to put our efforts in cleaning the hospital.\n
                 30 volunteers of SSNYRC gathered at kilpakkam Government Medical hospital, kilpakkam on 19-02-2017. There, we went to the orthopedic building which is a four-stored one.

There were about nearly 200 fans in the whole building. we had disposed of the plastics from the hospital surroundings. Our volunteers got so much pleased with humorous levels of the hospital people there. There treated us with great respect and love. They offered some eatable items to our people. They also offered a seminar about how to take immediate steps regarding heart-aches, nervous- disorders etc.\n
\n\n
